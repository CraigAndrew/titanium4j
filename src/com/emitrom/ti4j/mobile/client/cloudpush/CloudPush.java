/**
 * Provides methods for accessing Android push notifications from ACS using the
 * MQTT protocol.
 * <p>
 * The MQTT protocol is a very lightweight, long lived connection to a server.
 * It is perfect for keeping mobile devices in connection with a server, while
 * not significantly degrading their battery life.
 * <p>
 * In addition to communicating with an MQTT server, this module can also
 * present tray notifications to the user. Please refer to the
 * showTrayNotification property to see more information about this.
 * <p>
 * Note that this module is not included in the Titanium namespace, but it is
 * bundled with the Titanium SDK as of version 2.0.0. To use it, you must
 * require, like this : <br/>
 * {@code
 *   CloudPush.get();
 * }
 * <p>
 * This module must also be added to the modules section in your tiapp.xml. This
 * can be done using the Modules list in the Titanium Studio TiApp Editor, or by
 * editing the XML directly and adding the following line to the modules
 * element: <br/>
 * {@code
 *   <module platform="android">ti.cloudpush</module>
 * }
 * <p>
 * 
 * Your app must prove that it is allowed to talk to ACS. This keeps your data
 * secure by preventing anyone from making requests to ACS that impersonate your
 * app.
 * <p>
 * Titanium Studio will create a pair of keys (Development and Production) for
 * each Titanium application depending on the user preference specified during
 * new project creation. This pair of keys will be stored in tiapp.xml and one
 * of the keys will be used during application build depending on the build type
 * (development or production).
 * <p>
 * The supported properties in tiapp.xml are:<br/>
 * {@code <property name="acs-api-key-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT API KEY HERE</property>
 * <property name="acs-api-key-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION API KEY HERE</property>
 * <property name="acs-api-key" type="string">YOUR API KEY HERE</property>
 * }
